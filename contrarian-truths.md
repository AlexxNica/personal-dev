# Contrarian Truths

## It's possible to start a company without quitting your job

The general assumption of most startup founders is that they **need** to quit their jobs to start. The logic being that it communicates 100% commitment to VCs. I've found that the opposite is also true for the following reasons.

 1. You can bootstrap your startup with money from your job, retaining equity
 2. It communicates focus on efficacy over efficiency
 3. Its typical to have anxious energy around money and time. #1 reduces your anxiety around money, focusing your energy on time, which you can maximize with efficacy.

That was my intention, because I saw over the years, the people that worked out in the gym and that I met in the acting classes, they were all very vulnerable because they didn't have any money, and they had to take anything that was offered to them because that was their living. I didn't want to get into that situation. I felt if I was smart with real estate and took my little money that I had made in bodybuilding and in seminars and selling my courses through the mail, I could save up enough to put down on an apartment building...TF: This makes me think of one of my favorite negotiating maxims: 'In negotiation, he who cares the least wins.' He could ignore bit parts because he had cash flow from his real estate investments." - Schwarzenegger, Arnold. Ferriss, Tim. Tools of Titans.
